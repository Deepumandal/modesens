Modsens is an advanced platform that connects information to shoppers seamlessly for a secure and efficient experience — one that is wholly unique to their customers.

ModeSens is led by a team of industry experts who developed a solution to the disconnected and crowded online shopping experience. Product information was scattered, and shopping required too much research to make an informed purchase.

We have attempted to clone this website as a part of our unit-4 construct week.

Our Team includes.

1. Deepak Mandal.

2. Gagan Chandan.

3. Prathyush Nair.

4.Siddikkhan Imtiyajkhan Pathan.

In this project we have made use of React library to create an interactive UI. 

Chakra UI, BootStrap are some additional CSS library used in our project to provide a pleasant viewing experience to our users.

Some Glimpses of our website:
